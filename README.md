# Space-invaders Project version Alpha

I made this when I was still a student (in April 2016).

This is a simple HTML and jQuery game with a HTML grid system. I didn't even know the existence of canvas at this time (so don't be too rude!).

Live version: http://game.florianhermann.fr

To Do suggestion :
  - recursive call for function desc() with setTimeOut instead of setInterval in order to change interval
  - add different monsters
  - add bonus weapon for short delay
  - add music on option menu http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/sounds
  - Convert the existent code to canvas
  - ...
