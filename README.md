# Space_invaders Project version Alpha

If you have any idea you can update this file

To Do suggestion :
  - recursive call for function desc() with setTimeOut instead of setInterval in order to change interval
  - add different monsters
  - add bonus weapon for short delay
  - add music on option menu http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/sounds
  - Done: add webservice with best score table (only for difficulty hard on firstly)
  - ..
